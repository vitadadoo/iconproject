      <h1>Contextualizing the Importance of Clean Energy in Sunset Park
</h1>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <p class="container"> On September 24, Mayor Bill De Blasio announced a plan to invest $191 million and create 13,000 jobs in an offshore wind ecosystem located in Sunset Park. The initiative promises to develop best-in-class sites and infrastructure; prepare local businesses and New Yorkers to enter this industry; and promote innovation. This investment is representative of President Biden’s Justice40 executive order, whereby at least 40 percent of the jobs and investments go towards women, minorities, and environmental justice communities. To understand the potential impact of an offshore wind ecosystem in South Brooklyn, it’s important to consider the environmental, infrastructural, and public health risks that Sunset Park residents currently face. </p>

  <div class="text"> SUNSET PARK AS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY– NYC’s Environmental Justice Office defines Environmental Justice Areas as neighborhoods that have been historically overburdened by a rapidly changing climate due to social disparities as well as economic and health inequities. As an Environmental Justice Area, Sunset Park is especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such extreme heat, flooding, and catastrophic weather events.

      <div class="text"> ENERGY PRODUCTION– There are 3 peaker plants that serve the Sunset Park community. Peakers are historically inefficient, costly, and polluting. When in use, peaker generators emit a high level of pollutants relative to the electricity they generate. When New York’s gas-fired peaker plants are operating, they can account for over a third of the City’s daily Nitrogen Oxide emissions. Historically, peaker plants are located in Environmental Justice Areas, such as Sunset Park.

        <img src="images/communityhealth.png" alt="Community health icon"></div>
      <div class="text">COMMUNITY HEALTH– The leading cause of premature deaths in Sunset Park is cancer, particularly lung cancer. Further, 22% of the Sunset Park community is uninsured, which is lower than the borough and city average. Respiratory issues are linked to the proliferation of air pollution. Sunset Park’s proximity to peaker plants as well as heavy transit traffic from the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, burdens community health. Health effects of air pollution have been made ever so pressing in light of public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. </div>

      <div class="icon">
      <img src="images/waterfront.png" alt="Industrial waterfront icon"></div>
      <div class="text"> INDUSTRIAL WATERFRONT– Sunset Park is considered a Significant Maritime Industrial Areas, or SMIA. SMIA’s are zones designed to encourage the concentration of heavy industrial and polluting infrastructure. Recent and impending climate events such as heavy storms and hurricanes can have catastrophic effects on SMIAs that are prone to flooding, due to the accumulation of toxic waste.
